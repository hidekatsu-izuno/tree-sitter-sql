## Test Maintenance Notes
- Tests are organized by functionality for easy maintenance
- Each test case includes expected AST output
- Test expectations are automatically updated via `npx tree-sitter test --update`
- Tests cover both common usage and edge cases
- Test naming follows consistent patterns for discoverability

## Usage
Run all tests:
```bash
npx tree-sitter test
```

Update test expectations:
```bash
npx tree-sitter test --update
```

Run specific test file:
```bash
npx tree-sitter test test/corpus/01_basic_queries.txt
```

This comprehensive test suite ensures the SQLite tree-sitter parser correctly handles the full spectrum of SQLite syntax, from basic queries to advanced features and edge cases.
